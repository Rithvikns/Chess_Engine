# Method Formatting

- The method to_fens is missing self as the first parameter.

- Change to_fens(bitboards, ...) to to_fens(self, ...).

- Incorrect Bitboard Clearing in move_piece

- The line self.bitboards[piece] = self.bitboards[piece] & (0 << start) is incorrect.

- 0 << start always results in 0, meaning you are not actually clearing the bit.

- Instead, use self.bitboards[piece] &= ~(1 << start).

- Incorrect Logic in is_square_occupied

- The method currently returns False when a piece is present, which is the opposite of what it should do.

- Instead of return False, it should return True when a piece is found.

## Extra pass Statements

- pass is unnecessary in methods that already contain executable code.

- Remove pass from display, set_piece, move_piece, and get_occupancy.

- Fix Variable Name bitnoard_name

- In is_square_occupied, for bitnoard_name, bitboard in self.bitboards.items(): contains a typo.

- Change bitnoard_name to bitboard_name.

- Ensure FEN Uses Correct Characters

## When appending piece characters in to_fens, ensure they are correctly converted to FEN notation (though your current implementation looks mostly correct).

# General Improvements:
- Consider using Enum for piece names to improve readability.

- Add type hints for move_piece parameters (piece: str).

- get_occupancy could use sum() instead of | for better clarity (sum([self.bitboards[p] for p in pieces])).

- Fixing these issues will make your code more robust and readable! ðŸš€
