# Chessboard Representation using Bitboards

This module implements the chessboard using bitboards.
Each piece type and color has its own 64-bit integer, where each bit represents a square on the board.

Bitboard Index Mapping:
0  -> white_pawns
1  -> white_knights
2  -> white_bishops
3  -> white_rooks
4  -> white_queens
5  -> white_kings
6  -> black_pawns
7  -> black_knights
8  -> black_bishops
9  -> black_rooks
10 -> black_queens
11 -> black_kings
```console
Bitwise Operations Used:
- Setting a bit:    bitboard |= (1 << square)
- Clearing a bit:   bitboard &= ~(1 << square)
- Checking a bit:   bitboard & (1 << square)
- Flipping a bit:   bitboard ^= (1 << square)
