# Zobrist Hashing in Chess Engines

## Overview
Zobrist hashing is a technique used in chess engines to efficiently generate unique hash values for board positions. This helps in fast lookups for transposition tables, reducing redundant calculations and improving engine performance.

## How Zobrist Hashing Works
Zobrist hashing assigns a random 64-bit integer to each piece-square combination on a chessboard. The hash value of a board position is calculated using bitwise XOR operations on these values.

### Steps:
1. **Precompute Random Numbers**
   - Generate a table of random 64-bit integers for each piece on each square (e.g., White Knight on e4, Black Queen on d8, etc.).
   - Include additional values for castling rights, en passant targets, and side to move.

2. **Compute the Initial Hash**
   - XOR the random numbers corresponding to the current board position.

3. **Incremental Hash Updates**
   - When a move is made, the hash is updated by XORing out the piece's old position and XORing in its new position.
   - Adjust castling rights, en passant status, and side to move accordingly.

## Why Use Zobrist Hashing?
- **Speed**: Efficiently updates hash values instead of recalculating from scratch.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Enables fast lookups in transposition tables.
- **Collision Resistance**: With 64-bit hashes, the probability of collisions is very low in practical use.

## Applications in Chess Engines
- **Transposition Tables**: Detect repeated positions and avoid redundant computations.
- **Threefold Repetition Rule**: Check if a position has occurred three times to claim a draw.
- **Move Ordering**: Improve search efficiency in engines like Alpha-Beta pruning.

## Conclusion
Zobrist hashing is a fundamental optimization in modern chess engines, allowing for efficient position tracking and decision-making. By leveraging XOR operations and precomputed random values, engines can evaluate millions of positions quickly and accurately.
